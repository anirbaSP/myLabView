To do 5/12/13:

Add code to send out command/parameters when state/VS is not busy (for a new trial)


UDP data for realtime machine


Initial data:

1. %s %f, if not exit, then initial data received
2. %.3f to conver spreadsheet data into an array of numbers --- intial data. What I want to intial data to be?
3. read vs type, file subname, beh type, necessary?

updating parameters:

1. When trialDone, write TrlDone (%.3f, space, cycle number, space) into host UDP
